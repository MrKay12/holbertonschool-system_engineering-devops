Method
Components Setup:

Use 1 server to host all components.
Install Nginx as the web server to handle HTTP requests.
Set up an Application Server to run the backend logic and business processes.
Deploy Application Files (Codebase) for the web application.
Configure a MySQL Database for data storage.
Assign a domain name (foobar.com) with a www DNS record pointing to the server’s IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8).


DNS resolving the domain to IP.
Nginx as the entry point on the server.
The application server processing requests.
MySQL storing and retrieving data.
Add arrows showing communication between components.


Technical Details:

Configure Nginx to forward requests to the application server.
Use TCP/IP for communication between the user’s browser and the server.
Set up MySQL with the application server as its client.
Submission:

Take a picture/screenshot of your diagram and upload it to an image hosting service.
Provide the image link in the required file.
Explanations


Components:

Server: A computer hosting all the services and applications needed for the website.
Domain Name: Maps a human-readable address (www.foobar.com) to the server’s IP address using DNS.
DNS Record (www): Specifies that the subdomain www resolves to the server’s IP address.
Web Server (Nginx): Handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the application server.
Application Server: Executes business logic and generates responses.
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages application data.


Communication:

The user’s browser sends a request to www.foobar.com.
DNS resolves www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.
The request reaches Nginx on the server.
Nginx forwards the request to the application server.
The application server queries MySQL if needed, processes the data, and sends a response back to Nginx.
Nginx delivers the response to the user’s browser.


Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime During Maintenance:
Deploying new code or restarting the web server causes temporary unavailability.
Scalability:
A single server cannot handle high traffic efficiently.
